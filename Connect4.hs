--Data declaration

--Player is the token color of each player, either Red or Yellow
data Player = Red | Yellow deriving (Eq, Show)

--Position is the value in each spot of the game boared, either a player token, or an empty space
data Position = Player Player | Empty deriving (Eq, Show)

--Winner is either the Player and the set of moves they won with, or a tied board state where every slot is filled
--and there is no winning set of moves
--QUESTION: instead of having a tuple (Player, [Positions]), could we just have the winning player color?
--          the set of positions could be complicated to grab, and I don't think we will even do anything with it
--          its not like we have the cords stored to change anything in our output on a win
data Winner = Winner Player | None deriving (Eq, Show)

--Type declaration
--Move is the integer value of what column the move is trying to be placed in, should be in range 1-7 always
